# Becoming an Outlier

## The Outlier Motivation

This course is about rethinking your dev career.

This is _not_ a course for the masses. In fact, it's somewhat illogical.

If becoming an outlier does not appeal you should not watch this course.

Becoming an outlier is an extreme goal.

You should only watch this course if you view dev work as a calling.
You wake up every morning _overly exited_ about _what_ you're building.

You're going to become the weirdo!

Why do I want to become an outlier?

- Standout skills?
- Better pay?
- Meaningful work?
- Bigger impact?
- Wealth? (having options, _not money_).

(Personally I could pick all of the above...)

Three practices:

- Time to learn.
- People don't know about us.
- Allow chance to determine our career.

## 01 - Command Your Time

Theme: consistently spend time doing things that add value to _others_.

The tech treadmill is continually and rapidly moving.

If you find new tech interesting and rewarding you'll have no trouble.

Outliers tend to be highly exited by the rapidly changing landscape
of dev work.

### Habits

We're usually unaware of our bad habits. **Pay attention!**

Make a point of analyzing your habits and improve them.

Habits **are a choice**

Are you striving to exceed expectations?

Make a goal of becoming an expert!

10,000 hours

Deliberate practice is **not**:

- Staying in comfort zone.
- Mindless repetition
- Watching others.

It **is**:

- Doing what you're not good at.
- Striving to improve
- Evaluating your performance

Strive to continually improve!

If you put in 2 hours/day it takes 14 years to become an expert.

### 7 Facets of Life

If you want to become an outlier you must focus of self development.
What other areas can you sacrifice?

- Health
- Family
- Recreation
- Religion
- Civic
- Job

Learn to default to NO on low-priority areas.

You're on a mission. Are you willing to pay the cost?

Learn to command your time.

### Multithreaded Commute

Multithread your life!

Avg. commute if 50 min round trip.
216 hours / year. 5.5 weeks!

Hack the commute:

1. Eliminate it
2. Public transit (work on the road)
3. Mutithread commute
    - Cut the noise from life!
    - Listen to focused content.
    - Coding podcasts, etc.
    - Audiobooks (see site)
    - Learn skills outside of programming.
    - Notes while driving???

### Giving Back

Donate your most valuble skill.

- OSS contribution
- Pro bono dev work
- Give Camp

### Multithreaded Life

Listen/watch coding edu when working out.

Tasks that involve minimal thought are a great chance to multithread.

Work a bit when on road trips.

When coding **DO NOT MULTITASK**.
Multithreading **should only be done with mundane tasks**.

### Be Modal

Be aware, but not distracted by background topics.

Become highly focused on a single project.

Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration.

A developer's most precious resource is uninterrupted thought.

Getting _into the zone_ takes longer than getting the task done in most cases.

Rethink your meeting schedule!

### Stay Modal

- Private offices are desirable.
- Work from home if you can.
- Work an alternate schedule.
- Batch meetings
- Respect the headphones
- Write down where you were when you leave!

### Clear Your Mind

- Automate your personal life.
- Use reminders religiously.
- Automate mental clutter.
- Log your time.

### What is your default mode

- Use free time for personal improvement.
- Leaverage you outside of work time to improve your craft.
- Target your media consumption.

### Manicure Your Media

- Too much noise!
- Target media for your niche.
  - HackerNews
  - Reddit Programming
  - The Verge

  - TedTalks
  - CodingHorror
  - Hanselman
  - Code Complete
  - 7 Lang in 7 weeks
  - Patterns of enterprise app architect
- Agile Manifesto!
- Entertainment is okay in proper proportions!

### Life Changing Media

- Make sure that the media you intake will impact you correctly!
- The less news you consume the bigger advantage you have.
  - There is a lack of concrete impact in your life with news.
  - Try to stick with local news.
- In order to do big things you have to let the small bad things happen.

### Focus on Your Realm of Influence

- Focus on what you can influence!
  - Your influece will grow

### Money is Time

- The more you make the more time you can buy.
- We _could_ live on less than a 40 hour week. You choose not to.
- Outliers delegate. Hire household tasks!
- Some people are _too cheap_ to save money!

### Summary

- Habits are 40% of your day!
- Live beneath your means!

## Manage Your Image

### Perception is Reality

- People need to recognize you.
- Networking is critical!
- The best projects are filled by referral. Not job searches.

### The Dev Image Triagle

- Cheap/Good/Fast - Pick two.

- Pick two of these:
  - Be easy to work with
  - Do great work
  - Deliver on time

- Cordial Craftsman (Great work / Easy to work with)
  - Managers find them unreliable
  - They work great as mentors.
  - They are ivory tower devs.
  - "Architecture Astronaut"
- Reliable Robot (Great work / Deliver on time)
  - Dependable braniac
  - Smart, but cold.
- Happy Hacker (Deliver on time / Easy to work with)
  - Loved by managers.
  - Quality of solutions is sacrificed.
  - Debt generator
- Outliers figure out how to balance _all three_.
- You _must_ pick at least two.

### Purpose Built

- Be focused on a niche.
- Rare and focused == expensive.
- What am I known for?
- Bring solutions to your boss. **NOT PROBLEMS!**
- Be optimisic and exceed expectations.

### Self-Image

- Your self-image is your greatest constraint.
- Don't sell your weaknesses, sell your strengths.
- Is your self-image holding you back?
- Who you think you are is often limiting.
- I am who I think you think I am.

- Hack your self-image.
  - Start acting like what you want to be!
  - Change the way you see yourself.
- Leave to leap.
  - You may need to leave your job to improve your self image.
  - It may be time to move on.
- Are you reaching beyond your comfort zone?
  - Take scary interviews.
  - If you're not scared you're not stretching.
  - Become uncomfortable.

### The Conference Effect

- They know _way_ more than I do!
- Don't be dissuaded by apparent knowledge of others.

### Can I See Your Work

- Make sure that your work is visible online!
- If we cannot find you then we're likely not interested.
- Sell your skills!

### Become a Work Recycler

Learn skills and then:

1. Write a blog post
2. Tweet about it.
3. Do a lunch & learn
4. Speak at a conference
5. Answer forum questions
6. Contribute to OSS
7. Take a side contract

Make all your work public!

### Own Your Work

- Social networks control your content.
- If you have a blog _you_ control the content.
- An active blog is an excellent marketing tool.
- There is _no such thing_ as overnight success.

### Measure Your Brand

- Google Alerts
- TweetBeep
- Online ID Calc
- Bit.ly

### Shelved Creds

- Books are a physical reminder of your skills.
- They will say a lot about who you are.
- Conversation starters.
- _Known_ skills land work.

## Own Your Trajectory

### From Passive to Active

- We often allow circumstance to pick our career.
- Craft your skill set to the current need _before_ asked to.

Those in the passive mindset will let other things run their lives.
If you accept this mindset you will not have many options.

Outliers are active. You will decide on a goal and do what it takes
to get towards that goal.

### Freedom Matters

Strategically position yourself so are free to move on when you need to.

### 2 Keys to Freedom

If you have slack in your finances you can leave your job whenever

If you have in-demand skills you can find another job at a moment's notice.

### Key No. 1 - Finances

Clear your mind. Distractions make you dumber.

Tight finances: mental capacity drops.

Live well underneath your means.

### Key No. 2 - Skills

Regularly audit your skills to make sure that they are relevant.

TIOBE index.

Language demand varies by city. Use Dice.com

Do research for your region!

Is demand outpacing supply in your chosen tech?

The cutting edge and outdated techs will pay more.

Embrace change!

### Programming Your Brain

Watch someone else!

1. Watch someone in action
2. Experiment with real life.
3. Teach someone else how to do it.

Never apologize for learning. All of us are always learning in this industry.

### Exploration and Exploitation

Balance learning with implementation!

Make sure to use your new skills to benefit others.

### Assembly Line Coder

- Creates a new X in tech Y every Z days.

This will get you stuck in a rut.

Automate yourself out of a job.

Don't work for money; work to learn.

There is no sideways. You move forward to backward.

### Opportunity Curve

Our opportunities narrow down as we grow older.

An outlier will have consistently relevant skills even when older.

### Search for Scale

You can only sell and hour of your life once. This is non-scalable.

Make your work scalable.

What if every day moved you closer to automated pay?

Life falls into 3 levels:

1. Worker - Do whay told for pay
2. Leadership - Talk about the work and tell others what to do.
3. Own - Create your own product (SAAS, PAAS, Authors, etc.)

Are you brave enough to lead?

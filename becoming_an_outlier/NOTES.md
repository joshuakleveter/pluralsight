# Becoming an Outlier

## The Outlier Motivation

This course is about rethinking your dev career.

This is _not_ a course for the masses. In fact, it's somewhat illogical.

If becoming an outlier does not appeal you should not watch this course.

Becoming an outlier is an extreme goal.

You should only watch this course if you view dev work as a calling.
You wake up every morning _overly exited_ about _what_ you're building.

You're going to become the weirdo!

Why do I want to become an outlier?

- Standout skills?
- Better pay?
- Meaningful work?
- Bigger impact?
- Wealth? (having options, _not money_).

(Personally I could pick all of the above...)

Three practices:

- Time to learn.
- People don't know about us.
- Allow chance to determine our career.

## 01 - Command Your Time

Theme: consistently spend time doing things that add value to _others_.

The tech treadmill is continually and rapidly moving.

If you find new tech interesting and rewarding you'll have no trouble.

Outliers tend to be highly exited by the rapidly changing landscape
of dev work.

### Habits

We're usually unaware of our bad habits. **Pay attention!**

Make a point of analyzing your habits and improve them.

Habits **are a choice**

Are you striving to exceed expectations?

Make a goal of becoming an expert!

10,000 hours

Deliberate practice is **not**:

- Staying in comfort zone.
- Mindless repetition
- Watching others.

It **is**:

- Doing what you're not good at.
- Striving to improve
- Evaluating your performance

Strive to continually improve!

If you put in 2 hours/day it takes 14 years to become an expert.

### 7 Facets of Life

If you want to become an outlier you must focus of self development.
What other areas can you sacrifice?

- Health
- Family
- Recreation
- Religion
- Civic
- Job

Learn to default to NO on low-priority areas.

You're on a mission. Are you willing to pay the cost?

Learn to command your time.

### Multithreaded Commute

Multithread your life!

Avg. commute if 50 min round trip.
216 hours / year. 5.5 weeks!

Hack the commute:

1. Eliminate it
2. Public transit (work on the road)
3. Mutithread commute
    - Cut the noise from life!
    - Listen to focused content.
    - Coding podcasts, etc.
    - Audiobooks (see site)
    - Learn skills outside of programming.
    - Notes while driving???

### Giving Back

Donate your most valuble skill.

- OSS contribution
- Pro bono dev work
- Give Camp

### Multithreaded Life

Listen/watch coding edu when working out.

Tasks that involve minimal thought are a great chance to multithread.

Work a bit when on road trips.

When coding **DO NOT MULTITASK**.
Multithreading **should only be done with mundane tasks**.

### Be Modal

Be aware, but not distracted by background topics.

Become highly focused on a single project.

Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration.

A developer's most precious resource is uninterrupted thought.

Getting _into the zone_ takes longer than getting the task done in most cases.

Rethink your meeting schedule!

### Stay Modal

- Private offices are desirable.
- Work from home if you can.
- Work an alternate schedule.
- Batch meetings
- Respect the headphones
- Write down where you were when you leave!

### What is your default mode

## Manage Your Image

### Perception is Reality

### The Dev Image Triagle

- Cheap/Good/Fast - Pick two.

- Pick two of these:

  - Do great work
  - Deliver on time

- Cordial Craftsman (Great work / Easy to work with)
  - Managers find them unreliable
  - They work great as mentors.
  - They are ivory tower devs.
  - "Architecture Astronaut"
- Reliable Robot (Great work / Deliver on time)
  - Dependable braniac
  - Smart, but cold.
- Happy Hacker (Deliver on time / Easy to work with)
  - Loved by managers.
  - Quality of solutions is sacrificed.
  - Debt generator
- Outliers figure out how to balance _all three_.
- You _must_ pick at least two.

### Purpose Built

- Be focused on a niche.
- Rare and focused == expensive.
- What am I known for?
- Bring solutions to your boss. **NOT PROBLEMS!**

### Self-Image

- Your self-image is your greatest constraint.

  - You may need to leave your job to improve your self image.
  - It may be time to move on.

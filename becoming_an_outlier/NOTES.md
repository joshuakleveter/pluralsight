# Becoming an Outlier

## The Outlier Motivation

This course is about rethinking your dev career.

This is _not_ a course for the masses. In fact, it's somewhat illogical.

If becoming an outlier does not appeal you should not watch this course.

Becoming an outlier is an extreme goal.

You should only watch this course if you view dev work as a calling.
You wake up every morning _overly exited_ about _what_ you're building.

You're going to become the weirdo!

Why do I want to become an outlier?

- Standout skills?
- Better pay?
- Meaningful work?
- Bigger impact?
- Wealth? (having options, _not money_).

(Personally I could pick all of the above...)

Three practices:

- Time to learn.
- People don't know about us.
- Allow chance to determine our career.

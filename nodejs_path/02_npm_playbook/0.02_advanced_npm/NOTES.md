# NPM Playbook - Advanced NPM

- Installing from Git repos
  - `npm install` + git repo URL.
- Installing from a Gist
  - `npm install gist:` +  Gist hash
  - The Gist _must_ have a `package.json` file.
- Installing from a folder
  - `npm install` + path to folder
- NPM registry
  - Stores info about every package available
  - `npm.im/` + package name: go to package page.
- NPM search
  - CLI search is slow and less than useful
  - Website search is preferable
- Pruning
  - `npm prune`: remove extraneous packages
  - `--production`: flag to remove all dev deps and shrink package size
- `npm repo`: go to the Git repo for a package
- NPM scripts
  - `npm test`: script for running tests on the package.
  - `npm start`: script to start the project.

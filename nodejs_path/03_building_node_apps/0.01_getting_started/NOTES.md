# Building Node.js Applications - Getting Started

This course will start from the basics.

**Node.js** is an open-source server-side _runtime environment_.
It _is not_ a language. JavaScript is the language.

**Express** is an unopinionated web framework for Node.js.

## Node.js and the Command Line

Validate your Node.js install with `node --version`

The `node` CLI command will launch a Node.js REPL.

Ultimatley our entire app is just a single *.js file that Node.js is running.

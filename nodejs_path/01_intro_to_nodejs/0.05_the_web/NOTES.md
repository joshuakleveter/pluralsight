# Introduction to Node.js - Interacting with the Web

- Use Node.js as a web client and server.
- Using socket.IO

Node.js allows us to interact with the web through the HTTP module.

## Building a Web Server

Use `http.createServer()`

Use `.listen()` to start the server.

SSL requests are handled with the HTTPS module.

## Socket.IO

Allows us to use WebSockets where supported with automatic fallbacks.

Back-and-forth realtime communication with a streaming pattern.

# Introduction to Node.js - Testing and Debugging

- Unit testing with Node.js 'assert'
- Unit testing with Mocha

## Assert

Node.js built-in that allows for basic unit tests.

- Types of equlity:
  - .equal() - Equivalent of `==`
  - .strictEqual() - Equivalent of `===`
  - .deepEqual() - Testing of complex data types.

## Mocha

Mocha gives us a full unit testing framework with addition features
beyond the built-in assert module.

Using Mocha's `describe()` syntax gives us self-documented tests.

# jQuery: Getting Started

Using vanilla JS in the DOM is often far too verbose and complicated.

jQuery gives us a very simple way of interacting with the DOM without
the pain and complexety of the DOM.

jQuery also solves a number of cross browser compatability issues for us.
This is still applicable in modern web development.

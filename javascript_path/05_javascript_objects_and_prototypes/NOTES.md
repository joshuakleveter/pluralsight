# JavaScript Objects and Prototypes

## Creating JS Objects

We can create objects with any of the following:

- _Object Literal_
- _Constructor Function_
- _Object.create()_

The `class` syntax in ES6 does not create true classes like
a statically-typed language.

The `this` keyword refers to whatever Object is executing
the current code.

The `new` keyword sets the context of `this` to a new empty object.

_Constructor Functions_ are a common pattern for creating
multiple instances of similar objects in JS.

`class` syntax is just syntactic sugar.

# Rapid ES6 Training

By Mark Zamoyta

- ES6 is offically known as ES2015.

## Introduction

- What are the new features?
  - Fully back-compatible
  - New syntax
  - Modules and Classes
  - Object extenstions
  - New types
  - Iterators
  - Generators
  - Promises
  - Arrays and Collections
  - Reflect and Proxy APIs

In ES6 we should move away from the use of global functions and start using
the namespaces counterparts.

[ECMAScript Compatibility Table](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6)

To support older browsers and runtimes we need to use transpilers.
(e.g. Babel, Traceur)

Note that Modules have been separated from the main ES6 spec. As such, most
browsers and runtimes don't yet support them.

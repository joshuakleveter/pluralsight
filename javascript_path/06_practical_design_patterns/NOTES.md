# Practical Design Patterns in JavaScript

## What is a Design Pattern

Objects work differently in JS than other OOP languages (like Java and C#).

We should always think about design patterns based on the problem.
What problem are we trying to solve and which design pattern presents the
best solution?

Design patterns are a specific solution for a specific problem.

Software design patterns were originally coined in the book
_Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_.
It is most often referred to as _The Gang of Four Book_.

Always think in the order of **problem** -> **pattern**.
Not the other way around!

- A design pattern:
  - Solves a common problem.
  - Is a proven concept.
  - The solution is not obvious.
  - It describes a relationship 9 times of 10.
  - It has a significant human component.

### Why Use Patterns

- Why solve the problem again?
- It gives us a common vocabulary.
